go-vite
-------

vite, but in Go.

Works with vite projects. You will have to rework Jinja2 templates to Go
templates. Look at my site[1] for an example.

INSTALLING

Clone this repository and run
    
    $ make
    # doas make install

Requires `go` to be installed, obviously.

        new PATH        create a new markdown post
